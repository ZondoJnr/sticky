    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Playing the keyboard</h2>
    <p><strong>Learning new songs</strong> on the piano was an exciting journey for me. I remember spending hours in my room with my keyboard.</p>
    <p><em>Winning achievements for my school in choir competitions</em> was a proud childhood achievement. It motivated me to master the keys!</p>

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>I loved sketching superheroes with <em>bold, exaggerated features</em>. It sparked my imagination and creativity!</p>
    <p><strong>Accidentally turning my sketches into a mini comic</strong> became a funny family moment when I showed my masterpiece.</p>

    <h1>Toys</h1>
    <h2>Action Figures</h2>
    <p><em>Recreating battles</em> from my favorite TV shows with action figures was my way of bringing those stories to life.</p>
    <p>One toy had a loose arm, but it didn’t stop me from boldly declaring it my most trusted sidekick.</p>

    <h2>Building Blocks</h2>
    <p><strong>Constructing imaginative cities</strong> with colorful blocks was pure joy. It felt like being an architect in my tiny world.</p>
    <p>I once built a castle so tall it almost reached the table – <em>an epic success!</em></p>
