            <h2>About Keyboard Playing</h2>
            <p>A keyboard player is a musician who specializes in playing keyboard instruments, such as pianos, synthesizers, organs, and digital workstations.
                <br>These instruments are incredibly versatile and can produce a wide range of sounds, making keyboard players essential in many musical genres like classical, jazz, gospel, and 'amapiano' music.<br>Coming from a musical family, I had an inclination towards musical instruments from an early age.
                I have been playing keyboards since 2007.<br>For me, music is a way of life. I play at church for worship, I play in events for entertainment,
                and most importantly I play at home for fun!<br>And yes, I am a devout Roland fan!</p>
